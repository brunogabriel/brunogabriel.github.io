The system offers simple and intuitive interfaces to create mobile applications (Apps), without the need for any programming skill to develop them. The platform allows the collection of conventional data, such as numbers and text, and also non-conventional data, such as multimedia files, location information, and barcodes. The collected data can be shared among users on a social network. In addition, we propose a pipeline architecture to data analyzing."

Actually, it is increasingly common to use digital forms for mobile data acquisition using mobile devices (smartphones and tablets). This paper presents the project Maritaca, an open solution for create mobile applications to data gathering using Android mobile devices. By using the platform, no programming skill is needed to create the mobile applications. Moreover, the platform facilitates the sharing of the collected data in the cloud, thus allowing the formation of social networks for gathering and information sharing. The project was designed to support a heavy volume of users and data acquisition."
