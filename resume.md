**Pipeline Architecture for Mobile Data Analysis**

Abstract:
This paper presents a cloud architecture that allows collecting and analyzing mobile data. The system offers simple and intuitive interfaces to create mobile applications (Apps), without the need for any programming skill to develop them. The platform allows the collection of conventional data, such as numbers and text, and also non-conventional data, such as multimedia files, location information, and barcodes. The collected data can be shared among users on a social network. In addition, we propose a pipeline architecture to data analyzing.

**Open Architecture for Mobile Data Collection using Cloud Computing** 

Abstract:
Presents the architecture of Maritaca, a cloud infrastructure for mobile data collection. The system allows the user create mobile Apps for data gathering using simple interfaces; no programming skill is needed. The platform collects conventional data and, in addition, allows to collect multimedia, location information, sketches, barcodes, etc. The collected data can be shared, allowing the formation of small networks for sharing of mobile data. The data is stored in a scalable cloud infrastructure, based on Cassandra and Hadoop products. The system is based on free software and can be accessed in the following address: http://maritaca.unifesp.br.

**Empowering Mobile Users: Create Your Own Mobile Application for Data Collection in the Cloud**

Abstract:
This paper presents a cloud infrastructure that allows users to create mobile applications to collect and visualize data. The system offers simple and intuitive interfaces to create Apps, without the need for any programming skill to develop them. The platform allows the collection of conventional data, such as numbers and text, and also non-conventional data, such as multimedia files, location information, barcodes, etc. The collected data can be shared among users on a social network, allowing Apps to extract intelligence from the collected data. The system is based on free software and can be accessed at the following address: http://maritaca.unifesp.br .

**Ferramentas para Coleta Movel de Dados**

Abstract:
The usage of mobile devices is growing rapidly. Actually, it is increasingly common to use digital forms for mobile data acquisition using mobile devices (smartphones and tablets). This paper presents the project Maritaca, an
open solution for create mobile applications to data gathering using Android
mobile devices. By using the platform, no programming skill is needed to create the mobile applications. Moreover, the platform facilitates the sharing of the collected data in the cloud, thus allowing the formation of social networks for
gathering and information sharing. The project was designed to support a heavy volume of users and data acquisition. It is based on free software and canbe accessed at: maritaca.unifesp.br.
